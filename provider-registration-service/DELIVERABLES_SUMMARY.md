**Task:** Phase 1, Task 1.2 - SQL Injection Prevention
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Quick Overview

**Vulnerability Fixed:** SQL injection in `src/services/candidate_service.py`
**Attack Vectors Closed:** 2 (status and product query parameters)
**Security Tests Added:** 16 comprehensive tests
**Files Modified:** 1 (candidate_service.py)
**Documentation Created:** 5 comprehensive documents

---

## Deliverables Checklist

### 1. Code Changes ✅

**Modified Files:**
- ✅ `src/services/candidate_service.py`
  - Method: `list_candidates` (lines 70-134)
  - Change: Replaced dynamic WHERE clause with NULL-safe parameterized queries
  - LOC Changed: ~45 lines

**Key Improvements:**
- No f-strings in SQL queries
- NULL-safe filtering pattern: `(:param IS NULL OR column = :param)`
- Complete parameter binding for all user inputs
- Enhanced documentation with security notes
- DRY principle applied (helper method usage)

---

### 2. Security Testing ✅

3. ✅ `test_union_based_injection_attack` - UNION injection
4. ✅ `test_comment_injection_attack` - Comment-based injection
5. ✅ `test_time_based_blind_injection` - Time-based blind

7. ✅ `test_multiple_statement_injection` - Multiple statements
8. ✅ `test_product_jsonb_injection` - JSONB operator injection
9. ✅ `test_combined_filter_injection` - Combined parameters

**Functional Tests (4 tests):**
1. ✅ `test_legitimate_status_filter` - Status filtering works
2. ✅ `test_legitimate_product_filter` - Product filtering works
3. ✅ `test_legitimate_combined_filters` - Combined filters work

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working correctly:

### Step 1: Code Verification
```bash
# Check no f-strings in SQL
grep -r "text(f" src/services/candidate_service.py
# Expected: No matches (only backup file)

# Verify NULL-safe pattern exists
grep -r ":status IS NULL OR" src/services/candidate_service.py
# Expected: 2 matches (query and count_query)
```

### Step 2: Security Scan
```bash
# Run automated security scanner
python security_scan.py
# Expected: "No SQL injection vulnerabilities found!"
```

### Step 3: Test Execution
```bash
# Run penetration tests
pytest tests/test_sql_injection.py -v
# Expected: All 16 tests PASS
```

### Step 4: Manual Testing
```bash
# Start service
docker-compose up -d

# Test legitimate query
curl "http://localhost:5004/candidates?status=pending"
# Expected: Valid JSON response

# Test injection attempt (should fail safely)
curl "http://localhost:5004/candidates?status=pending';DROP+TABLE+candidates;--"
# Expected: Empty result or 422 error (no 500 error)
```
