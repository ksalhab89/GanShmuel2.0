# Login: admin / Ma3fiVksYL8yq+bsYA+oX2UWm7ea4cLp
```

### 3. **Metrics Collection**

## üéØ Key Talking Points for Interviews

### "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved"
**Answer:**
"I implemented an API Gateway pattern using Traefik to reduce the attack surface from 16 exposed ports down to 1. This involved configuring path-based routing, middleware chains for security headers, and automatic service discovery via Docker labels. The challenge was maintaining proper OpenAPI documentation while services are behind a reverse proxy - I solved this by configuring the `root_path` parameter in FastAPI."

**Files to show:**
- docker-compose.yml (service labels)
- infrastructure/gateway/ (Traefik config)

---

### "How do you ensure code quality?"
**Answer:**
"I use a multi-layered approach: automated testing in CI/CD (GitHub Actions), code coverage tracking with Codecov, security scanning with Trivy and GitGuardian, and type checking with mypy. All pull requests must pass these gates before merging. I also implement health checks on all services and monitor metrics with Prometheus."

**Files to show:**
- .github/workflows/
- Test coverage reports
- pytest configuration

---

### "Describe your experience with containerization"
**Answer:**
"I've orchestrated 16 containers using Docker Compose, including multi-stage builds for optimization, health checks for reliability, and proper networking for service discovery. Each service uses a minimal base image and runs as a non-root user for security. I've also implemented proper volume management for data persistence and configured resource limits."

**Files to show:**
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfiles in each service
- .dockerignore files

---

### "How do you approach monitoring and observability?"
**Answer:**
"I use the Prometheus + Grafana stack for observability. All services expose `/metrics` endpoints with custom business metrics like transactions processed and bills generated, alongside standard system metrics. I've configured MySQL exporters for database monitoring and health checks for service availability. Grafana dashboards provide real-time visibility."

**Files to show:**
- infrastructure/monitoring/
- Grafana dashboards
- Prometheus queries

---

### "What security practices do you follow?"
**Answer:**
"I follow a defense-in-depth approach: API Gateway as single entry point, no database ports exposed, security headers on all responses, environment-based CORS, automated credential generation, vulnerability scanning in CI/CD, and secrets never committed to git. I also implemented rate limiting and authentication where needed."

**Files to show:**
- PHASE1_SECURITY_NOTES.md
- scripts/generate-secrets.sh
- .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
